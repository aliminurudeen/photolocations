      <h1>About Photo Locations</h1>

      <p>Welcome to Photo Locations. The app is aimed at all of you
        who like travelling and photography. I love to see new Locations
        but sometimes struggle to find interesting places to photograph when I
        have only limited time to explore and would still like to come home with
        some amazing shots.
      </p>
      <p>Hopefully this site will prove useful to you as well. You are welcome to
        drop me a comment over on the Contacts page at any time</p>
      <p>Happy snapping!!</p>
      <p>Cornelia</p>
    </div>
